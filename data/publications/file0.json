This is due to the massive use of tools such as credit cards for electronic payments which are targeted by attackers to steal sensitive information and perform fraudulent operations. Although intelligent fraud detection systems have been developed to face the problem, they still suffer from some well-known problems due to the imbalance of the used data. Therefore this paper proposes a novel data intelligence technique based on a Prudential Multiple Consensus model which combines the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art classification algorithms by adopting a twofold criterion, probabilistic and majority based. The goal is to maximize the effectiveness of the model in detecting fraudulent transactions regardless the presence of any data imbalance. Our model has been validated with a set of experiments on a large real-world dataset characterized by a high degree of data imbalance and results show how the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art solutions, both in terms of ensemble models and classification approaches.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004254388","authid":"7004254388","authname":"Carta S.","surname":"Carta","given-name":"Salvatore","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469552000","authid":"24469552000","authname":"Fenu G.","surname":"Fenu","given-name":"Gianni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56029094200","authid":"56029094200","authname":"Saia R.","surname":"Saia","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Credit card | Fraud detection | Information security | Machine learning","source-id":"21100332403","fund-no":"F72F16003030002","fund-sponsor":"Fondazione Banco di Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043494295"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043494295?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043494295&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85043494295&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0747563218301092"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85043494295","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85043494295","eid":"2-s2.0-85043494295","dc:title":"Bridging learning analytics and Cognitive Computing for Big Data classification in micro-learning video collections","dc:creator":"Dessì D.","prism:publicationName":"Computers in Human Behavior","prism:issn":"07475632","prism:volume":"92","prism:pageRange":"468-477","prism:coverDate":"2019-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"March 2019","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.004","pii":"S0747563218301092","dc:description":"© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Moving towards the next generation of personalized learning environments requires intelligent approaches powered by analytics for advanced learning contexts with enriched digital content. Micro-Learning through Massive Open Online Courses is riding the wave of popularity as a novel paradigm for delivering short educational videos in small pre-organized chunks over time, so that learners can get knowledge in a manageable way. However, with the ever-increasing number of videos, it has become challenging to arrange and search them according to specific categories. In this paper, we get around the problem by bridging Learning Analytics and Cognitive Computing to analyze the content of large video collections, going over traditional term-based methods. We propose an efficient and effective approach to automatically classify a collection of educational videos on pre-existing categories which uses (i) a Speech-to-Text tool to get video transcripts, (ii) Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing methods to extract semantic concepts and keywords from video transcripts for their representation, and (iii) Apache Spark as Big Data technology for scalability. Several classifiers are trained on the feature vectors extracted by Cognitive Computing tools. Then, we compared our approach with other combinations of state-of-the-art feature types and classifiers over a large-scale dataset we collected from Coursera. Considering the experimental results, we expect our approach can facilitate the development of Learning Analytics tools powered by Cognitive Computing to support content managers on micro-learning video management while improving how learners search videos.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192682012","authid":"57192682012","authname":"Dessì D.","surname":"Dessì","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469552000","authid":"24469552000","authname":"Fenu G.","surname":"Fenu","given-name":"Gianni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193883534","authid":"57193883534","authname":"Marras M.","surname":"Marras","given-name":"Mirko","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Big Data technologies | Cognitive Computing | Learning Analytics | Micro-learning video | Multi-class classification | Video classification","source-id":"19419","fund-acr":"ESF","fund-no":"F72F16003030002","fund-sponsor":"Fondazione Banco di Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064376260"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064376260?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064376260&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064376260&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064376260","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064376260","eid":"2-s2.0-85064376260","dc:title":"Data science in healthcare: Benefits, challenges and opportunities","dc:creator":"Abedjan Z.","prism:publicationName":"Data Science for Healthcare: Methodologies and Applications","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030052492"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030052485"}],"prism:pageRange":"3-38","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-05249-2_1","dc:description":"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. The advent of digital medical data has brought an exponential increase in information available for each patient, allowing for novel knowledge generation methods to emerge. Tapping into this data brings clinical research and clinical practice closer together, as data generated in ordinary clinical practice can be used towards rapid-learning healthcare systems, continuously improving and personalizing healthcare. In this context, the recent use of Data Science technologies for healthcare is providing mutual benefits to both patients and medical professionals, improving prevention and treatment for several kinds of diseases. However, the adoption and usage of Data Science solutions for healthcare still require social capacity, knowledge and higher acceptance. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of needs, opportunities, recommendations and challenges of using (Big) Data Science technologies in the healthcare sector.

MARIO is an assistive robot that has to support a set of knowledge-intensive tasks aimed at increasing autonomy and reducing loneliness in people with dementia and supporting caregivers in their activity to assess patients’ cognitive status. Examples of knowledge-intensive tasks are the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and the delivery of reminiscence therapy. In order to enable these tasks, MARIO features a set of abilities implemented by pluggable software applications. MARIO’s abilities contribute to and benefit from a common knowledge management framework. For example, the ability associated with the CGA retrieves questions to be posed to the patient from the framework and stores the obtained answers and associated relevant metadata. In this work we presents the MARIO knowledge management software framework, which combines robotics with ontology-based approaches and Semantic Web technologies. It consists of (1) a set of interconnected and modularized ontologies, meant to model all knowledge areas that are relevant for MARIO abilities, and (2) a set of software interfaces that provide high-level access to the ontology network and its associated knowledge base. Finally, we demonstrate how the knowledge management framework supports the applications for CGA and reminiscence therapy, implemented on top of the knowledge base.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191745706","authid":"57191745706","authname":"Asprino L.","surname":"Asprino","given-name":"Luigi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198414185","authid":"57198414185","authname":"Russo A.","surname":"Russo","given-name":"Alessandro","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]}],"source-id":"21100903549","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064356813"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064356813?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064356813&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064356813&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064356813","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064356813","eid":"2-s2.0-85064356813","dc:title":"Internet of entities (IoE): A blockchain-based distributed paradigm for data exchange between wireless-based devices","dc:creator":"Saia R.","prism:publicationName":"SENSORNETS 2019 - Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Sensor Networks","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789897583551"}],"prism:pageRange":"77-84","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","dc:description":"Copyright 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved The exponential growth of wireless-based solutions, such as those related to the mobile smart devices (e.g., smart-phones and tablets) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has lead to countless advantages in every area of our society. Such a scenario has transformed the world a few decades back, dominated by latency, into a new world based on an efficient real-time interaction paradigm. Recently, cryptocurrency has contributed to this technological revolution, whose fulcrum is a decentralization model and a certification function offered by the so-called blockchain infrastructure, which makes it possible to certify the financial transactions, anonymously. This paper aims to indicate a possible approach able to exploit this challenging scenario synergistically by introducing a novel blockchain-based distributed paradigm for data exchange between wireless-based devices defined Internet of Entities (IoE). It is based on two core elements with interchangeable roles, entities and trackers, which can be implemented by using existing infrastructures and devices, such as those related to smart-phones, tablets, and IoT systems. The employment of the blockchain-based distributed paradigm allows our approach ensuring the anonymization and immutability of the involved data, which is key in many scenarios and domains (e.g. financial applications, health and legal applications dealing with personal and sensitive data), requirements more and more searched in recent innovations. The possibility to exchange data among a huge number of devices gives rise to a novel and widely exploitable data environment, whose applications are possible in different domains, such as, in Security, eHealth, and Smart Cities.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56029094200","authid":"56029094200","authname":"Saia R.","surname":"Saia","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004254388","authid":"7004254388","authname":"Carta S.","surname":"Carta","given-name":"Salvatore","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469552000","authid":"24469552000","authname":"Fenu G.","surname":"Fenu","given-name":"Gianni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Blockchain | Distributed Ledger | Internet of Entities | Internet of Things | Mobile Network","source-id":"21100904282","fund-acr":"MIUR","fund-no":"F74G14000200008 F19G14000910008","fund-sponsor":"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062538952"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062538952?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062538952&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062538952&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062538952","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062538952","eid":"2-s2.0-85062538952","dc:title":"Analysis of topic propagation in therapy sessions using partially labeled latent dirichlet allocation","dc:creator":"Chaoua I.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030127374"}],"prism:volume":"11326 LNAI","prism:pageRange":"59-75","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-12738-1_5","dc:description":"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Basically, understanding the topics dynamics of previous cases allows choosing the best therapy to perform for new patients depending on their current conversations. In this paper we leverage Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation with the goal to detect and track topics in real-life psychotherapeutic conversations. On the one hand, the detection of topics allows us identifying the semantic themes of the current therapeutic conversation and predicting topics ad-hoc for each talk-turn between the patient and the counselor. On the other hand, the tracking of topics is key to understand and explore the dynamics of the conversation giving insights and tips on logic and strategy to adopt. We point out that the entire conversation is structured and modeled according to a sequence of ongoing topics that might propagate through each talk-turn. We present a new method that combines topic modeling and transitions matrices that gives important information to counselors for their therapeutic strategies.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016561","afid":"60016561","affilname":"Philips Research","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203206701","authid":"57203206701","authname":"Chaoua I.","surname":"Chaoua","given-name":"Ilyas","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701367190","authid":"6701367190","authname":"Härmä A.","surname":"Härmä","given-name":"Aki","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36141897700","authid":"36141897700","authname":"Helaoui R.","surname":"Helaoui","given-name":"Rim","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Conversational AI | Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation | Psychotherapeutic conversations | Topics detection and modeling | Transitions matrices","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061358378"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061358378?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061358378&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061358378&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85061358378","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85061358378","eid":"2-s2.0-85061358378","dc:title":"MARIO Project: Experimentation in the Hospital Setting","dc:creator":"D’Onofrio G.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering","prism:issn":"18761100","prism:eIssn":"18761119","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030046712"}],"prism:volume":"540","prism:pageRange":"289-303","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-04672-9_20","dc:description":"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. In the EU funded MARIO project, specific technological tools are adopted for the patient with dementia (PWD). At this stage of the project, the experimentation phase is under way, and the first two trials were completed as shown below: the first trial was performed in November 2016, and second trial was performed in April 2017. The current implemented and assessed applications (apps) are My Music app, My News app, My Games app, My Calendar app, My Family and Friends app, and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) app. The aim of the present study was to provide a preliminary analysis of the acceptability and efficacy of MARIO companion robot on clinical, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, affective and social aspects, resilience capacity, quality of life in PWD, and burden level of the caregivers. Thirteen patients [5 patients (M = 3; F = 2) in first trial, and 8 patients (M = 6; F = 2) in second trial] were screened for eligibility and all were included. At admission and at discharge, the following tests were administered: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Hachinski Ischemic Scale (HIS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS-21), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Social Dysfunction Rating Scale (SDRS), Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), Quality of Life in Alzheimer’s Disease (QOL-AD), Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Tinetti Balance Assessment (TBA), and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) was carried out. A questionnaire based on the Al-mere Acceptance model was used to evaluate the acceptance of the MARIO robot. During the first trial, My Music, My Games and My News apps were used. At discharge, no significant improvement was shown through the above questionnaires. During the second trial, My Music, My Games, My News, My Calendar, My Family and Friends, and CGA apps were used. At discharge, significant improvements were observed in the following parameters: NPI (p = 0.027), GDS-15 (p = 0.042), and BRS (p = 0.041), CBI (p = 0.046). Instead, the number of medications is increased at discharge (p = 0.038). The mean of hospitalization days is 5.6 ± 3.9 (range = 3–13 days). The Almere Model Questionnaire suggested, a higher acceptance level was shown in first and second trial.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. During the last decades, a huge amount of data have been collected in clinical databases in the form of medical reports, laboratory results, treatment plans, etc., representing patients health status. Hence, digital information available for patient-oriented decision making has increased drastically but it is often not mined and analyzed in depth since: (i) medical documents are often unstructured and therefore difficult to analyze automatically, (ii) doctors traditionally rely on their experience to recognize an illness, give a diagnosis, and prescribe medications. However doctors experience can be limited by the cases they are treated so far and medication errors can occur frequently. In addition, it is generally hard and time-consuming inferring information for comparing unstructured data and evaluating similarities between heterogeneous resources. Technologies as Data Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning can provide possibilities to explore and exploit potential knowledge from diagnosis history records and help doctors to prescribe medication correctly to decrease medication error effectively. In this paper, we design and implement a medical recommender system that is able to cluster a collection of medical reports on features detected by IBM Watson and Framester, two emerging tools from, respectively, Cognitive Computing and Frame Semantics, and then, giving a medical report from a specific patient as input, to recommend similar other medical reports from patients who had analogues symptoms. Experiments and results have proved the quality of the resulting clustering and recommendations, and the key role that these innovative services can play on the biomedical sector. The proposed system is able to classify new medical cases thus supporting physicians to take more correct and reliable actions about specific diagnosis and cares.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016561","afid":"60016561","affilname":"Philips Research","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"ch","subtypeDescription":"Chapter","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192682012","authid":"57192682012","authname":"Dessì D.","surname":"Dessì","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469552000","authid":"24469552000","authname":"Fenu G.","surname":"Fenu","given-name":"Gianni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]}],"authkeywords":"Biomedical text-mining | Clustering | Cognitive computation | Data mining | Health recommender systems | Knowledge inference | Personal health records | Personalized medicine | Relevance computation","source-id":"21100222537","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"European Social Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060186177"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060186177?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060186177&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060186177&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85060186177","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85060186177","eid":"2-s2.0-85060186177","dc:title":"Forecasting E-commerce products prices by combining an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and Google Trends data","dc:creator":"Carta S.","prism:publicationName":"Future Internet","prism:eIssn":"19995903","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-12-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 December 2018","prism:doi":"10.3390/fi11010005","dc:description":"© 2019 by the author. E-commerce is becoming more and more the main instrument for selling goods to the mass market. This led to a growing interest in algorithms and techniques able to predict products future prices, since they allow us to define smart systems able to improve the quality of life by suggesting more affordable goods and services. The joint use of time series, reputation and sentiment analysis clearly represents one important approach to this research issue. In this paper we present Price Probe, a suite of software tools developed to perform forecasting on products' prices. Its primary aim is to predict the future price trend of products generating a customized forecast through the exploitation of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We experimented the effectiveness of the proposed approach on one of the biggest E-commerce infrastructure in the world: Amazon. We used specific APIs and dedicated crawlers to extract and collect information about products and their related prices over time and, moreover, we extracted information from social media and Google Trends that we used as exogenous features for the ARIMA model. We fine-estimated ARIMA's parameters and tried the different combinations of the exogenous features and noticed through experimental analysis that the presence of Google Trends information significantly improved the predictions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004254388","authid":"7004254388","authname":"Carta S.","surname":"Carta","given-name":"Salvatore","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36630821900","authid":"36630821900","authname":"Medda A.","surname":"Medda","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205494489","authid":"57205494489","authname":"Pili A.","surname":"Pili","given-name":"Alessio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56029094200","authid":"56029094200","authname":"Saia R.","surname":"Saia","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Amazon | ARIMA | Google Trends | Machine learning | Smart systems | Time-series forecasting","article-number":"5","source-id":"21100409311","fund-no":"CUP F74G14000200008 F19G14000910008","fund-sponsor":"Regione Autonoma della Sardegna","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054730116"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054730116?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054730116&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054730116&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054730116","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054730116","eid":"2-s2.0-85054730116","dc:title":"Using frame-based resources for sentiment analysis within the financial domain","dc:creator":"Atzeni M.","prism:publicationName":"Progress in Artificial Intelligence","prism:issn":"21926352","prism:eIssn":"21926360","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"273-294","prism:coverDate":"2018-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 December 2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/s13748-018-0162-8","dc:description":"© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. User-generated data in blogs and social networks have recently become a valuable resource for sentiment analysis in the financial domain, since they have been shown to be extremely significant to marketing research companies and public opinion organizations. In order to identify bullish and bearish sentiments associated with companies and stocks, we propose a fine-grained approach that returns a continuous score in the [-1,+1] range. Our supervised approach leverages a frame-based ontological resource which produces feature sets such as lexical features, semantic features and their combination. One of the outcome of our analysis suggests that the frame-based ontological resource we have used might be successfully applied for sentiment analysis within the financial domain achieving better results than traditional sentiment analysis methods that do not embody semantics. We also show the higher performance of a fine-grained approach based solely on the evaluation of specific substrings of the message, rather than on features extracted from the whole text of a financial microblog message through the frame-based ontological resource. We have also compared our system with semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches and results indicate that our approach outperforms the others. Last but not the least, our approach is general and can be applied on top of any existing supervised method of polarity detection.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195407967","authid":"57195407967","authname":"Atzeni M.","surname":"Atzeni","given-name":"Mattia","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56543357900","authid":"56543357900","authname":"Dridi A.","surname":"Dridi","given-name":"Amna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"BabelNet | Financial domain | Frame semantics | Microblogs | News | Regression | Sentiment analysis","source-id":"21100781972","fund-no":"2020","fund-sponsor":"Fondazione Banco di Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054412495"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054412495?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054412495&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054412495&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054412495","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85054412495","eid":"2-s2.0-85054412495","dc:title":"SuperNoder: a tool to discover over-represented modular structures in networks","dc:creator":"Dessì D.","prism:publicationName":"BMC bioinformatics","prism:eIssn":"14712105","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"318","prism:coverDate":"2018-09-10","prism:coverDisplayDate":"10 September 2018","prism:doi":"10.1186/s12859-018-2350-8","dc:description":"BACKGROUND: Networks whose nodes have labels can seem complex. Fortunately, many have substructures that occur often (\"motifs\"). A societal example of a motif might be a household. Replacing such motifs by named supernodes reduces the complexity of the network and can bring out insightful features. Doing so repeatedly may give hints about higher level structures of the network. We call this recursive process Recursive Supernode Extraction.RESULTS: This paper describes algorithms and a tool to discover disjoint (i.e. non-overlapping) motifs in a network, replacing those motifs by new nodes, and then recursing. We show applications in food-web and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks where our methods reduce the complexity of the network and yield insights.CONCLUSIONS: SuperNoder is a web-based and standalone tool which enables the simplification of big graphs based on the reduction of high frequency motifs. It applies various strategies for identifying disjoint motifs with the goal of enhancing the understandability of networks.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60003261","afid":"60003261","affilname":"Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"pubmed-id":"30200901","prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192682012","authid":"57192682012","authname":"Dessì D.","surname":"Dessì","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202581654","authid":"57202581654","authname":"Cirrone J.","surname":"Cirrone","given-name":"Jacopo","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003261"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005430203","authid":"7005430203","authname":"Shasha D.","surname":"Shasha","given-name":"Dennis","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60003261"}]}],"authkeywords":"Computational complexity | Food-web network | Motifs discovery | Network compression | PPI interaction network","source-id":"17929","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058998023"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058998023?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058998023&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058998023&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058998023","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058998023","eid":"2-s2.0-85058998023","dc:title":"A probabilistic-driven ensemble approach to perform event classification in intrusion detection system","dc:creator":"Saia R.","prism:publicationName":"IC3K 2018 - Proceedings of the 10th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9789897583308"}],"prism:volume":"1","prism:pageRange":"141-148","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","dc:description":"Copyright 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved Nowadays, it is clear how the network services represent a widespread element, which is absolutely essential for each category of users, professional and non-professional. Such a scenario needs a constant research activity aimed to ensure the security of the involved services, so as to prevent any fraudulently exploitation of the related network resources. This is not a simple task, because day by day new threats arise, forcing the research community to face them by developing new specific countermeasures. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) covers a central role in this scenario, as its main task is to detect the intrusion attempts through an evaluation model designed to classify each new network event as normal or intrusion. This paper introduces a Probabilistic-Driven Ensemble (PDE) approach that operates by using several classification algorithms, whose effectiveness has been improved on the basis of a probabilistic criterion. A series of experiments, performed by using real-world data, show how such an approach outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors, proving its better capability to detect intrusion events with regard to the canonical solutions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56029094200","authid":"56029094200","authname":"Saia R.","surname":"Saia","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7004254388","authid":"7004254388","authname":"Carta S.","surname":"Carta","given-name":"Salvatore","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Ensemble approach | Intrusion detection | Machine learning | Pattern mining | Probabilistic model","source-id":"21100892577","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Regione Autonoma della Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055671069"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055671069?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055671069&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055671069&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055671069","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85055671069","eid":"2-s2.0-85055671069","dc:title":"Fine-Tuning of Word Embeddings for Semantic Sentiment Analysis","dc:creator":"Atzeni M.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030000714"}],"prism:volume":"927","prism:pageRange":"140-150","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-00072-1_12","dc:description":"© 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art deep-learning approach for sentiment polarity classification. Our approach is based on a 2-layer bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network, equipped with a neural attention mechanism to detect the most informative words in a natural language text. We test different pre-trained word embeddings, initially keeping these features frozen during the first epochs of the training process. Next, we allow the neural network to perform a fine-tuning of the word embeddings for the sentiment polarity classification task. This allows projecting the pre-trained embeddings in a new space which takes into account information about the polarity of each word, thereby being more suitable for semantic sentiment analysis. Experimental results are promising and show that the fine-tuning of the embeddings with a neural attention mechanism allows boosting the performance of the classifier.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università

As a consequence of the social revolution we faced on the Web, news and information we daily enjoy may come from different and diverse sources which are not necessarily the traditional ones such as newspapers, either in their paper or online version, television, radio, etc. Everyone on the Web is allowed to produce and share news which can soon become viral if they follow the new media channels represented by social networks. This freedom in producing and sharing news comes with a counter-effect: the proliferation of fake news. Unfortunately, they can be very effective and may influence people and, more generally, the public opinion.

This may provide insights on the therapeutic strategy adopted by the counselor for the specific patient, providing the opportunity of building up artificial intelligence (AI) based methods for recommending the most appropriate therapy for a new patient. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect and track topics in real-life psychotherapeutic conversations based on Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation. Topics detection helps in summarizing the semantic themes used during the therapeutic conversations, and in predicting a specific topic for each talk-turn. The conversation is modeled by means of a distribution of ongoing topics propagating through each talk sequence. Tracking of topics aims at exploring the dynamics of the conversation and at offering insights into the underlying conversation logic and strategy. We present an alternative way to look at face-to-face conversations in conjunction with a new approach that combines topic modeling and transitions matrices to elicit valuable knowledge.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016561","afid":"60016561","affilname":"Philips Research","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203206701","authid":"57203206701","authname":"Chaoua I.","surname":"Chaoua","given-name":"Ilyas","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701367190","authid":"6701367190","authname":"Härmä A.","surname":"Härmä","given-name":"Aki","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36141897700","authid":"36141897700","authname":"Helaoui R.","surname":"Helaoui","given-name":"Rim","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]}],"authkeywords":"Conversational AI | Modeling | Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation | Psychotherapeutic conversations | Topics detection | Transitions matrices","source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049108349"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049108349?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049108349&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85049108349&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049108349","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85049108349","eid":"2-s2.0-85049108349","dc:title":"Supervised topic-based message polarity classification using cognitive computing","dc:creator":"Ferru D.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"2111","prism:pageRange":"11-21","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","dc:description":"© CEUR-WS.

All rights reserved. In this paper we present a tool that performs two tasks: given an input image, first, (i) it detects whether the image corresponds to a male or female person and then (ii), it further recognizes which emotion the face expression of the detected person is conveying. We mapped the two tasks as multi-label classifications. The first one aims at identifying if the input image contains one of the following four categories: one male person, one female person, a group of both male and female persons or if the image does not contain any person. The second task is triggered whether the image has been recognized to belong to one of the first two classes and aims at detecting whether that image is conveying one among six different emotions: sadness, anger, surprise, happiness, disgust, fear. For both the problems, Microsoft Cognitive Services have been leveraged to extract tags from the input image. Tags are text elements that have been adopted to form the vectorial space model, using the bag of words model, that has been fed to the machine learning classifiers for the prediction tasks. For both tasks, we manually annotated 3000 images, which have been extracted from students who agreed using our system and providing their Facebook pictures for our analysis. Our evaluation uses Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers and with a 10-fold cross-validation reached satisfactory accuracies both for the two tasks and for the combination of them. Finally, our system works online and has been integrated with social media. In that way, any visitors logged in to Facebook through its APIs, is allowed to quickly classify any of their photos.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202710253","authid":"57202710253","authname":"Corriga A.","surname":"Corriga","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202708330","authid":"57202708330","authname":"Cusimano S.","surname":"Cusimano","given-name":"Simone","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202710033","authid":"57202710033","authname":"Malloci F.","surname":"Malloci","given-name":"Francesca M.","initials":"F.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202705397","authid":"57202705397","authname":"Marchesi L.","surname":"Marchesi","given-name":"Lodovica","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cognitive services | Emotion detection | Image classification | Machine learning | Social media","source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"F72F16003030002","fund-sponsor":"Fondazione Banco di Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045293492"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045293492?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045293492&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045293492&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045293492","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85045293492","eid":"2-s2.0-85045293492","dc:title":"COCO: Semantic-enriched collection of online courses at scale with experimental use cases","dc:creator":"Dessì D.","prism:publicationName":"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","prism:issn":"21945357","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319777115"}],"prism:volume":"746","prism:pageRange":"1386-1396","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_133","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. With the proliferation in number and scale of online courses, several challenges have emerged in supporting stakeholders during their delivery and fruition. Machine Learning and Semantic Analysis can add value to the underlying online environments in order to overcome a subset of such challenges (e.g. classification, retrieval, and recommendation). However, conducting reproducible experiments in these applications is still an open problem due to the lack of available datasets in Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL), mostly small and local. In this paper, we propose COCO, a novel semantic-enriched collection including over 43 K online courses at scale, 16 K instructors and 2,5 M learners who provided 4,5 M ratings and 1,2 M comments in total. This outruns existing TEL datasets in terms of scale, completeness, and comprehensiveness. Besides describing the collection procedure and the dataset structure, we depict and analyze two potential use cases as meaningful examples of the large variety of multi-disciplinary studies made possible by having COCO.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192682012","authid":"57192682012","authname":"Dessì D.","surname":"Dessì","given-name":"Danilo","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24469552000","authid":"24469552000","authname":"Fenu G.","surname":"Fenu","given-name":"Gianni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193883534","authid":"57193883534","authname":"Marras M.","surname":"Marras","given-name":"Mirko","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Classification | Dataset | Online courses | Recommendation","source-id":"5100152904","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"European Social Fund","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028078061"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028078061?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028078061&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028078061&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0950705117303702"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028078061","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85028078061","eid":"2-s2.0-85028078061","dc:title":"Event-based knowledge reconciliation using frame embeddings and frame similarity","dc:creator":"Alam M.","prism:publicationName":"Knowledge-Based Systems","prism:issn":"09507051","prism:volume":"135","prism:pageRange":"192-203","prism:coverDate":"2017-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2017.08.014","pii":"S0950705117303702","dc:description":"© 2017 Elsevier B.V. This paper proposes an evolution over MERGILO, a tool for reconciling knowledge graphs extracted from text, using graph alignment and word similarity. The reconciled knowledge graphs are typically used for multi-document summarization, or to detect knowledge evolution across document series. The main point of improvement focuses on event reconciliation i.e., reconciling knowledge graphs generated by text about two similar events described differently. In order to gather a complete semantic representation of events, we use FRED semantic web machine reader, jointly with Framester, a linguistic linked data hub represented using a novel formal semantics for frames. Framester is used to enhance the extracted event knowledge with semantic frames. We extend MERGILO with similarities based on the graph structure of semantic frames and the subsumption hierarchy of semantic roles as defined in Framester. With an effective evaluation strategy similarly as used for MERGILO, we show the improvement of the new approach (MERGILO plus semantic frame/role similarities) over the baseline.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006341","afid":"60006341","affilname":"Universität Mannheim","affiliation-city":"Mannheim","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56020393700","authid":"56020393700","authname":"Alam M.","surname":"Alam","given-name":"Mehwish","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24339046000","authid":"24339046000","authname":"Mongiovi M.","surname":"Mongiovi","given-name":"Misael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55321570300","authid":"55321570300","authname":"Ristoski P.","surname":"Ristoski","given-name":"Petar","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006341"}]}],"authkeywords":"Frame embeddings | Frame semantics | Frame similarity | FrameNet | Framester | Knowledge reconciliation | Role embeddings | Role similarity","source-id":"24772","fund-no":"17.05.201","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006894333"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006894333?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85006894333&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85006894333&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S2214579616301289"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006894333","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85006894333","eid":"2-s2.0-85006894333","dc:title":"Producing Linked Data for Smart Cities: The Case of Catania","dc:creator":"Consoli S.","prism:publicationName":"Big Data Research","prism:eIssn":"22145796","prism:volume":"7","prism:pageRange":"1-15","prism:coverDate":"2017-03-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 March 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.bdr.2016.10.001","pii":"S2214579616301289","dc:description":"© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Semantic Web technologies and in particular Linked Open Data provide a means for sharing knowledge about cities as physical, social, and technical systems, so enabling the development of smart city applications. This paper presents a prototype based on the case of Catania with the aim of sharing the lessons learnt, which can be reused as reference practices in other cases with similar requirements. The importance of achieving syntactic as well as semantic interoperability – as a result of transforming heterogeneous sources into Linked Data – is discussed: semantic interoperability is solved at data level in order to ease further development on top. We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance. Domain practitioners and general members of the public have been asked to play with the prototype, and fill out a survey with questions and feedbacks. A computational experiment has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of our data model in terms of practical scalability over increasing data and efficiency under complex queries. All produced data, models, prototype and questionnaire results are publicly accessible online.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016561","afid":"60016561","affilname":"Philips Research","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016561"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea G.","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35183805200","authid":"35183805200","authname":"Peroni S.","surname":"Peroni","given-name":"Silvio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24339046000","authid":"24339046000","authname":"Mongiovi' M.","surname":"Mongiovi'","given-name":"Misael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]}],"authkeywords":"Data modeling | Interoperability | Linked Open Data for smart cities | RDF data processing | Semantics and eGovernment","source-id":"21100356018","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045919780"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045919780?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045919780&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85045919780&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045919780","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85045919780","eid":"2-s2.0-85045919780","dc:title":"Reconciling event-based knowledge through RDF2Vec","dc:creator":"Alam M.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"1923","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"© 2017 CEUR-WS.
