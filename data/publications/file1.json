Sentiment Analysis is a widely studied research field in both research and industry, and there are different approaches for addressing sentiment analysis related tasks. Sentiment Analysis engines implement approaches spanning from lexicon-based techniques, to machine learning, or involving syntactical rules analysis. Such systems are already evaluated in international research challenges. However, Semantic Sentiment Analysis approaches, which take into account or rely also on large semantic knowledge bases and implement Semantic Web best practices, are not under specific experimental evaluation and comparison by other international challenges. Such approaches may potentially deliver higher performance, since they are also able to analyze the implicit, semantics features associated with natural language concepts. In this paper, we present the fourth edition of the Semantic Sentiment Analysis Challenge, in which systems implementing or relying on semantic features are evaluated in a competition involving large test sets, and on different sentiment tasks. Systems merely based on syntax/word-count or just lexicon-based approaches have been excluded by the evaluation. Then, we present the results of the evaluation for each task and show the winner of the most innovative approach award, that combines several knowledge bases for addressing the sentiment analysis task.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005510","afid":"60005510","affilname":"Nanyang Technological University","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/119761159","afid":"119761159","affilname":"Research Scientist at Finsa s.p.a.","affiliation-city":"Genoa","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56140547500","authid":"56140547500","authname":"Cambria E.","surname":"Cambria","given-name":"Erik","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005510"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57192942274","authid":"57192942274","authname":"Di Rosa E.","surname":"Di Rosa","given-name":"Emanuele","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"119761159"}]}],"source-id":"17700155007","fund-acr":"CUP","fund-no":"F72F16003030002","fund-sponsor":"Fondazione Banco di Sardegna","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034257137"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034257137?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034257137&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85034257137&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034257137","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85034257137","eid":"2-s2.0-85034257137","dc:title":"AMR2FRED, A Tool for Translating Abstract Meaning Representation to Motif-Based Linguistic Knowledge Graphs","dc:creator":"Meloni A.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319704067"}],"prism:volume":"10577 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"43-47","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_9","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

With the increasing availability of manually AMR-annotated datasets, this tool provides straightforward means to adapt annotated datasets for AMR according to the design patterns used by FRED, and to evaluate machine reading tools with gold-standard data.

This paper describes theShukran Sentiment Analysis system. TheShukran is a social network micro-blogging service that allows users posting photos or videos and descriptions of their daily life activities. This social network rapidly gained a large amount of users. It provides people from different cultures and countries the possibility to share in different languages their stories, ideas, opinions, and news from their real life, and makes the cultural diversity the center of relationships between its users. Sentiment analysis aims to extract the opinion of the public about some topic by processing text data. One of its several tasks, the polarity detection, aims at categorizing the elements in a dataset (sentences, posts, etc.) into classes such as positive, negative and neutral. In the system we propose, and that represents the sentiment analysis core engine of theShukran social network, we will detect the original language of users posts, translate them into English and evaluate their sentiment (whether positive, negative or neutral). We propose the use of a Naive Bayes classifier and SentiWordNet and SenticNet for the sentiment evaluation. The language detection and translation are performed using TextBlob, a Python library for processing textual data.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57197734073","authid":"57197734073","authname":"Iguider W.","surname":"Iguider","given-name":"Walid","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Naive Bayes | Natural language processing | Polarity detection | SenticNet | Sentiment analysis | SentiWordNet","source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033464031"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033464031?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85033464031&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85033464031&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033464031","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85033464031","eid":"2-s2.0-85033464031","dc:title":"Frame embeddings for event-based knowledge reconciliation","dc:creator":"Alam M.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"1963","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"This paper focuses on reconciling knowledge graphs generated from two text documents about similar events described differently.

In particular, in the medical domain, this problem is even more stressed and is earning more and more attention. Medical reports may contain relevant information that can be employed, among many useful applications, to build predictive systems able to classify new medical cases thus supporting physicians to take more correct and reliable actions about diagnosis and cares. It is generally hard and time consuming inferring information for comparing unstructured data and evaluating similarities between various resources. In this work we show how it is possible to cluster medical reports, based on features detected by using two emerging tools, IBM Watson and Framester, from a collection of text documents.

In this paper a fine-grained approach is proposed to predict a real-valued sentiment score. We use several feature sets consisting of lexical features, semantic features and combination of lexical and semantic features. To evaluate our approach a microblog messages dataset is used. Since our dataset includes confidence scores of real numbers within the [0-1] range, we compare the performance of two learning methods: Random Forest and SVR. We test the results of the training model boosted by semantics against classification results obtained by n-grams. Our results indicate that our approach succeeds in performing the accuracy level of more than 72% in some cases.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56543357900","authid":"56543357900","authname":"Dridi A.","surname":"Dridi","given-name":"Amna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195407967","authid":"57195407967","authname":"Atzeni M.","surname":"Atzeni","given-name":"Mattia","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"3","fund-sponsor":"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027844714"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027844714?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027844714&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027844714&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027844714","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027844714","eid":"2-s2.0-85027844714","dc:title":"MORE SENSE: MOvie REviews SENtiment analysis boosted with SEmantics","dc:creator":"Dridi A.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"1874","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","dc:description":"Sentiment analysis is becoming one of the most active area in Natural Language Processing nowadays. Its importance coincides with the growth of social media and the open space they create for expressing opinions and emotions via reviews, forum discussions, microblogs, Twitter and social networks. Most of the existing approaches on sentiment analysis rely mainly on the presence of affect words that explicitly reflect sentiment. However, these approaches are semantically weak, that is, they do not take into account the semantics of words when detecting their sentiment in text. Only recently a few approaches (e.g. sentic computing) started investigating towards this direction. Following this trend, this paper investigates the role of semantics in sentiment analysis of movie reviews. To this end, frame semantics and lexical resources such as BabelNet are employed to extract semantic features from movie reviews that lead to more accurate sentiment analysis models. Experiments are conducted with different types of semantic information by assessing their impact in movie reviews dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that F1 measure increases slightly when using semantics in sentiment analysis in social media. Results show that the proposed approach considering word's semantics for sentiment analysis is a promising direction.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56543357900","authid":"56543357900","authname":"Dridi A.","surname":"Dridi","given-name":"Amna","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"BabelNet | Frame semantics | Movie reviews | Sentiment analysis","source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"3","fund-sponsor":"Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027405891"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027405891?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027405891&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85027405891&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027405891","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85027405891","eid":"2-s2.0-85027405891","dc:title":"Semantic Web Machine Reading with FRED","dc:creator":"Gangemi A.","prism:publicationName":"Semantic Web","prism:issn":"15700844","prism:eIssn":"22104968","prism:volume":"8","prism:issueIdentifier":"6","prism:pageRange":"873-893","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.3233/SW-160240","dc:description":"© 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Open Knowledge Extraction (OKE) is the process of extracting knowledge from text and representing it in formalized machine readable format, by means of unsupervised, open-domain and abstractive techniques. Despite the growing presence of tools for reusing NLP results as linked data (LD), there is still lack of established practices and benchmarks for the evaluation of OKE results tailored to LD. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by constructing RDF graph banks, based on the definition of logical patterns called OKE Motifs. We demonstrate the usage and extraction techniques of motifs using a broad-coverage OKE tool for the Semantic Web called FRED.

This paper introduces an open, interoperable, and cloud-computing-based citizen engagement platform for the management of administrative processes of public administrations, which also increases the engagement of citizens. The citizen engagement platform is the outcome of a 3-year Italian national project called PRISMA (Interoperable cloud platforms for smart government; http://www.ponsmartcities-prisma.it/). The aim of the project is to constitute a new model of digital ecosystem that can support and enable new methods of interaction among public administrations, citizens, companies, and other stakeholders surrounding cities. The platform has been defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian “cloud” that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with the aim of developing new applications (“Cloud Apps”) tailored to the specific needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around the whole region (local developers have already used available application programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full exploitation.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

2016. Semantic web applications leveraging NLP can benefit from easy access to expressive lexical resources such as FrameNet. However, the usefulness of FrameNet is affected by its limited coverage and nonstandard semantics. The access to existing linguistic resources is also limited because of poor connectivity among them. We present some strategies based on Linguistic Linked Data to broaden FrameNet coverage and formal linkage of lexical and factual resources. We created a novel resource, Framester, which acts as a hub between FrameNet, Word- Net, VerbNet, BabelNet, DBpedia, Yago, DOLCE-Zero, as well as other resources. Framester is not only a strongly connected knowledge graph, but also applies a rigorous formal treatment for Fillmore’s frame semantics, enabling full-fledged OWL querying and reasoning on a large framebased knowledge graph. We also describe Word Frame Disambiguation, an application that reuses Framester data as a base in order to perform frame detection from text, with results comparable in precision to the state of the art, but with a much higher coverage.","citedby-count":"24","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56020393700","authid":"56020393700","authname":"Alam M.","surname":"Alam","given-name":"Mehwish","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191745706","authid":"57191745706","authname":"Asprino L.","surname":"Asprino","given-name":"Luigi","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"authkeywords":"Frame detection | Frame semantics | FrameNet | Framenet coverage | Framester | Knowledge graphs | Linguistic linked data","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992450924"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992450924?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992450924&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84992450924&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992450924","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84992450924","eid":"2-s2.0-84992450924","dc:title":"ACM: Article content miner for assessing the quality of scientific output","dc:creator":"Nuzzolese A.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319465647"}],"prism:volume":"641","prism:pageRange":"281-292","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-46565-4_22","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

The wide spread of the social media has given users a means to express and share their opinions and thoughts on a large range of topics and events. The number of opinions, emotions, sentiments that are being expressed within social media grows at an exponential rate; all these data can be exploited in order to come up with useful insights, analytics, etc. Initial Sentiment Analysis systems used lexical and statistical resources to automatically assess polarities of opinions and sentiment. With the raise of the Semantic Web, it has been proved that Sentiment Analysis techniques can have higher performances if they use semantic features. This generated further opportunities for the research domain as well as the market domain where key stakeholders need to catch up with the latest technology if they want to be compelling. Therefore, deep understanding of natural language text and the related semantics are urgent matter to be familiar with. Following the first two editions, the third edition of the Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis challenge aims at providing a stimulus toward this direction. On the one hand, it represents an event where researchers can learn and share their methods and how they employed Semantics for Sentiment Analysis. On the other hand, it offers an occasion for stakeholders to get an idea of what research is being developed and where the research is headed to plan future strategies within the domain of Sentiment Analysis.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60083112","afid":"60083112","affilname":"Fondazione Bruno Kessler","affiliation-city":"Trento","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19638448200","authid":"19638448200","authname":"Dragoni M.","surname":"Dragoni","given-name":"Mauro","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60083112"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]}],"source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988474773"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988474773?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988474773&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84988474773&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988474773","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84988474773","eid":"2-s2.0-84988474773","dc:title":"Towards interval version of fuzzy synsets","dc:creator":"Hossayni S.","prism:publicationName":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","prism:issn":"09226389","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781614996958"}],"prism:volume":"288","prism:pageRange":"297-302","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.3233/978-1-61499-696-5-297","dc:description":"© 2016 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved. WordNet-like Lexical Databases (WLDs) group English words into synsets, being utilized in several text mining applications. Synsets were also open to criticism, because while synset members (wordsenses) are, in practice, considered as compeers, yet in theory not all of them represent the synset meaning with a same degree. Considering this criticism, fuzzy synsets (considering synsets as fuzzy sets) have been proposed. In this study, we show why the standard fuzzy synsets do not properly-enough model the membership uncertainty, and propose an upgraded version of them in which membership degrees are represented by intervals (similar to what in Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Sets). We present an algorithm for constructing the interval fuzzy version of WLDs of a language, given a large enough multicontextual corpus of documents and a precise enough word-sense-disambiguation (WSD) system of that language. Utilizing the algorithm, we produced interval fuzzy synsets of English WordNet (for the frequent-enough synsets). For evaluation, we compared the results with crowdsourced data, asking people to rate the min/max compatibility degree of wordsenses of a synset with its definition. Comparisons, promisingly, showed the algorithm accuracy. The algorithm has also the drawback of being applicable only for synsets with wordsenses having enough frequency in all the corpus categories. This drawback is going to be covered in our future work.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029311","afid":"60029311","affilname":"University of Southern California","affiliation-city":"Los Angeles","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009952","afid":"60009952","affilname":"Universitat de Girona","affiliation-city":"Girona","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001800","afid":"60001800","affilname":"Ferdowsi University of Mashhad","affiliation-city":"Mashhad","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189367820","authid":"57189367820","authname":"Hossayni S.","surname":"Hossayni","given-name":"Sayyed Ali","initials":"S.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009952"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001800"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35566435300","authid":"35566435300","authname":"Rajati M.","surname":"Rajati","given-name":"Mohammad R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029311"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55665338600","authid":"55665338600","authname":"Del Acebo E.","surname":"Del Acebo","given-name":"Esteve","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009952"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56241971800","authid":"56241971800","authname":"Akbarzadeht M.","surname":"Akbarzadeht","given-name":"Mohammad R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001800"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57115450600","authid":"57115450600","authname":"De La Rosa Esteva J.","surname":"De La Rosa Esteva","given-name":"Josep Lluis","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009952"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fuzzy Synsets | Interval Fuzzy Synsets | Possibility Theory | Word Sense Disambiguation | WordNet","source-id":"19500157321","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978531738"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978531738?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978531738&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978531738&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978531738","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84978531738","eid":"2-s2.0-84978531738","dc:title":"Adjective semantics in open knowledge extraction","dc:creator":"Gangemi A.","prism:publicationName":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","prism:issn":"09226389","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781614996590"}],"prism:volume":"283","prism:pageRange":"167-180","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.3233/978-1-61499-660-6-167","dc:description":"© 2016 The authors and IOS Press. Adjectives carry a lot of discourse semantics, often being the core elements to understand the literal, emotional, cultural, and metaphoric meaning of a sentence. Their formal semantics has been investigated specially in lexical semantics and formal linguistics, with some contributions from formal ontology and the semantic web. However, no standard formal treatment of adjectives is available yet, which is capable to address the concerns of both theoretical and computational natural language understanding.

A broad variety of such resources are Synsetbased Lexical Databases (SLDs) (e.g. SWN is based on WordNet (WN)) and represent sentiment degrees of synonym groups of LDs, called \"synsets.\" However, synsets themselves were open to criticism because although, in reality, not all the members of a synset represent its meaning with the same degree, in SLDs, they are, identically, considered as members of their synset. Therefore, the fuzzy version of synsets was proposed in a small number of previous studies. Fuzzy synsets can upgrade such lexicon-based SA by which the future SA systems can discriminate between word-senses of a same synset, how much each of them contains the sentiment load of that synset. But, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies on fuzzy synsets has proposed any algorithm for providing fuzzy versions of \"predefined synsets\" of an SLD. In this study, we present the idea of an algorithm for constructing fuzzy version of any SLD of any language, given a corpus of that language and a word-sense-disambiguation system of that language/SLD.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032259","afid":"60032259","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Cagliari","affiliation-city":"Cagliari","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009952","afid":"60009952","affilname":"Universitat de Girona","affiliation-city":"Girona","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001800","afid":"60001800","affilname":"Ferdowsi University of Mashhad","affiliation-city":"Mashhad","affiliation-country":"Iran"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57189367820","authid":"57189367820","authname":"Hossayni S.","surname":"Hossayni","given-name":"Sayyed Ali","initials":"S.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009952"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001800"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603491496","authid":"6603491496","authname":"Akbarzadeh-T M.","surname":"Akbarzadeh-T","given-name":"Mohammad R.","initials":"M.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001800"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032259"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188815679","authid":"57188815679","authname":"De La Rosa I Esteva J.","surname":"De La Rosa I Esteva","given-name":"Josep Lluís","initials":"J.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009952"}]}],"authkeywords":"Fuzzy synsets | Lexicon-based approach | Probability to possibility transformation | Sentiment analysis | Synsets","source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971554079"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971554079?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84971554079&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84971554079&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971554079","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84971554079","eid":"2-s2.0-84971554079","dc:title":"From hyperlinks to Semantic Web properties using Open Knowledge Extraction","dc:creator":"Presutti V.","prism:publicationName":"Semantic Web","prism:issn":"15700844","prism:eIssn":"22104968","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"351-378","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.3233/SW-160221","dc:description":"© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. Open information extraction approaches are useful but insufficient alone for populating the Web with machine readable information as their results are not directly linkable to, and immediately reusable from, other Linked Data sources. This work proposes a novel paradigm, named Open Knowledge Extraction, and its implementation (Legalo) that performs unsupervised, open domain, and abstractive knowledge extraction from text for producing machine readable information. The implemented method is based on the hypothesis that hyperlinks (either created by humans or knowledge extraction tools) provide a pragmatic trace of semantic relations between two entities, and that such semantic relations, their subjects and objects, can be revealed by processing their linguistic traces (i.e. the sentences that embed the hyperlinks) and formalised as Semantic Web triples and ontology axioms. Experimental evaluations conducted on validated text extracted from Wikipedia pages, with the help of crowdsourcing, confirm this hypothesis showing high performances.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]}],"authkeywords":"abstractive summarisation | link semantics | open information extraction | Open Knowledge Extraction | relation extraction","source-id":"21100269620","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
