Besides energy saving that is possible to achieve, another positive side effect of this is the reduction of the working temperature of internal components of telecommunications devices (switches, home gateway, routers, etc.). This idea is encouraging the development of routers of reduced dimensions as long as there is the knowledge that the temperature remains in a given range. For this reason the target of this paper is to propose a governor policy that provides the best trade-off between quality of service and energy saving in respect of a given target on the working temperature. More specifically, such a governor is in charge to manage the clock frequency of the Central Processor Unit (CPU) of the green router according to the traffic loading the router, varying the processing engine performance, the working temperature and the power consumption of the hardware at the same time. The proposed policy is then applied to a case study and evaluated by simulation to show how it can be used for the above purposes, and to allow green router designers to control the temperature statistics of a router and design the governor parameters to maintain the mean temperature below a given threshold.

The most common approach to this end is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The new service providers are manifesting great interest not only for classical multimedia applications, like video streaming and video on demand, but also for multi-party games, private video-chat rooms, videoconference and real-time video teaching, usually containing a small number of high-interactive group members. The target of this paper is to define a multipoint multimedia communication platform for such kind of applications, accounting both peer set variation (peer arrivals and departures) and peer bandwidth modifications. In addition, a revenue model for providers of this kind of services is proposed to allow them to design their networks in order to maximize their revenue while satisfying user requirements in terms of both admission rejection probability and perceived quality on the received video stream. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23566568300","authid":"23566568300","authname":"Incarbone G.","surname":"Incarbone","given-name":"Giuseppe","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101813955","authid":"7101813955","authname":"Lombardo A.","surname":"Lombardo","given-name":"Alfio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003865210","authid":"7003865210","authname":"Schembra G.","surname":"Schembra","given-name":"Giovanni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bandwidth fluctuation | Multimedia | P2P | Peer churn | Revenue model","source-id":"25627","fund-no":"PQ/2007-2013","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879486650"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879486650?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879486650&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879486650&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84879486650","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84879486650","eid":"2-s2.0-84879486650","dc:title":"Modeling temperature and dissipation behavior of an open multi-frequency green router","dc:creator":"Lombardo A.","prism:publicationName":"2012 IEEE Online Conference on Green Communications, GreenCom 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781479903962"}],"prism:pageRange":"120-125","prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","prism:doi":"10.1109/GreenCom.2012.6519627","dc:description":"Development of green routers aimed at saving energy when the input traffic is low has the positive side effect of reducing the working temperature of their internal components.

For this reason, the implementation of rate adaptation facilities in the routers constitutes a challenging problem to make the network energy efficient. Rate adaptation in the green routers is usually achieved by scaling the processing power according to the data rate the router has to manage; at this purpose the clock frequency driving the router processes can be modified according to the input data rate. In this context this paper, starting from a measurement study of the Reference Router implemented on the NetFPGA platform, defines a model of the consumed power as a function of both the managed input traffic and the available clock frequencies. As demonstrated in the paper, the model can be applied by router designers to choose the main router platform parameters, i.e. the number of clock frequencies and the clock frequency switching time, while respecting a given tradeoff between the percentage of energy saved and the maximum tolerated loss probability due to frequency switch. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"21","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101813955","authid":"7101813955","authname":"Lombardo A.","surname":"Lombardo","given-name":"Alfio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23478208200","authid":"23478208200","authname":"Panarello C.","surname":"Panarello","given-name":"Carla","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003865210","authid":"7003865210","authname":"Schembra G.","surname":"Schembra","given-name":"Giovanni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"article-number":"6503584","source-id":"145242","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872405289"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872405289?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872405289&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872405289&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84872405289","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84872405289","eid":"2-s2.0-84872405289","dc:title":"A Markov model to control heat dissipation in open multi-frequency green routers","dc:creator":"Lombardo A.","prism:publicationName":"2012 Sustainable Internet and ICT for Sustainability, SustainIT 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783901882463"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-12-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"One of the main goals of telecommunications engineering today is to make Internet routers green.

The proposed model is applied to a case study to show how it can be used to design some router Governor parameters to achieve the target of maintaining the average temperature below a given threshold. © 2012 IFIP.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101813955","authid":"7101813955","authname":"Lombardo A.","surname":"Lombardo","given-name":"Alfio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55557239100","authid":"55557239100","authname":"Riccobene V.","surname":"Riccobene","given-name":"Vincenzo","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7003865210","authid":"7003865210","authname":"Schembra G.","surname":"Schembra","given-name":"Giovanni","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"authkeywords":"Green Routers | Heat Dissipation | Markov model | NetFPGA | Performance Evaluation | Power Consumption","article-number":"6388034","source-id":"21100226430","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867577000"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867577000?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867577000&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867577000&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0140366412002691"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867577000","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84867577000","eid":"2-s2.0-84867577000","dc:title":"Design of a service platform for delay-sensitive video streaming applications based on multicast p2p and scalable MDC encoding","dc:creator":"Favalli L.","prism:publicationName":"Computer Communications","prism:issn":"01403664","prism:volume":"35","prism:issueIdentifier":"18","prism:pageRange":"2254-2263","prism:coverDate":"2012-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 November 2012","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.comcom.2012.08.006","pii":"S0140366412002691","dc:description":"The great diffusion of Internet accesses in the world and the enormous evolution of the Internet technologies have strongly determined dissemination and consolidation of many applications of video content distribution. However, multicast real-time video communications for interactive service applications with a very high number of users, like for example multipoint videoconferences and interactive video games, remains a challenging research topic for the presence of very strict requirements in terms of end-to-end delay and perceived quality. The target of this paper is to propose a video distribution platform that is able to provide a huge number of users with a delay constrained multicast video streaming. To this purpose, the proposed content delivery platform is based on a peer-to-peer approach that exploits multicast overlay organization of the peers to address the challenges due to bandwidth heterogeneity. To improve reliability and flexibility, video is coded using a scalable multiple description approach. Some design guidelines are provided taking into account some requirements in terms of delay, average PSNR, robustness against underlying network bandwidth fluctuations, and fairness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To curb their energy requirements, next-generation hardware platforms of network devices are expected to include advanced power management capabilities, which may allow a dynamic trade-off between power consumption and network performance. At the same time, network protocols are going to evolve in order to carry energy-aware information, and to add them to classical performance indexes in network optimisation strategies. However, the question of how to map energy-aware indexes, often arising from low-level local hardware details, and the ones related to network performance is still an open issue. Starting from these considerations, we propose the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), a device internal interface that provides a standard way of accessing and organising energy-aware information from the low-level hardware components to control processes. The GAL is specifically designed to hide the heterogeneous hardware implementation details, and to provide a simple, hierarchical, and common view of underlying power management capabilities to network control processes. © 2012 IEEE.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103966","afid":"60103966","affilname":"Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni","affiliation-city":"Parma","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026638","afid":"60026638","affilname":"Nokia Corporation","affiliation-city":"Espoo","affiliation-country":"Finland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025059","afid":"60025059","affilname":"Dublin City University","affiliation-city":"Dublin","affiliation-country":"Ireland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113123749","afid":"113123749","affilname":"Lightcomm S.r.l.","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"8"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113123749"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101813955","authid":"7101813955","authname":"Lombardo A.","surname":"Lombardo","given-name":"Alfio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113123749"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12239775200","authid":"12239775200","authname":"Davoli F.","surname":"Davoli","given-name":"Franco","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55639527900","authid":"55639527900","authname":"Fialho L.","surname":"Fialho","given-name":"Leonardo","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101625911","authid":"7101625911","authname":"Collier M.","surname":"Collier","given-name":"Martin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025059"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26644017800","authid":"26644017800","authname":"Donadio P.","surname":"Donadio","given-name":"Pasquale","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026638"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006403406","authid":"7006403406","authname":"Bolla R.","surname":"Bolla","given-name":"Raffaele","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103966"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8555973600","authid":"8555973600","authname":"Bruschi R.","surname":"Bruschi","given-name":"Roberto","initials":"R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103966"}]}],"article-number":"6249924","source-id":"21100218117","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867211355"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867211355?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867211355&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867211355&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84867211355","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84867211355","eid":"2-s2.0-84867211355","dc:title":"Power control and management in the NetFPGA gigabit router","dc:creator":"Lombardo A.","prism:publicationName":"2012 Future Network and Mobile Summit, FutureNetw 2012","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781905824304"}],"prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2012-10-12","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2012","dc:description":"Improving energy efficiency in Internet equipments is becoming an increasingly important research topic.

This means that we are able to change any field of any incoming packets; of course, depending on whether we are changing TCP or IP header fields, we need to recompute the TCP or IP checksum and store them back into the packets. It might be useful to change information of the IP or TCP header or the data itself. For example, we could crypto the data, change the URL address in order to point to the desired web site or for URL filtering, change the priority information of a bunch of data, and much more.

For example, when RDF triples are extracted automatically by information extraction programs, there is a need to represent where the triples came from, what their temporal validity is, and how certain we are that the triple is correct. Today, there is no theoretically clean and practically scalable mechanism that spans these different needs - reification is the only solution propose to date, and its implementations have been ugly. In this paper, we present Annotated RDF (or aRDF for short) in which RDF triples are annotated by members of a partially ordered set (with bottom element) that can be selected in any way desired by the user. We present a formal declarative semantics (model theory) for annotated RDF and develop algorithms to check consistency of aRDF theories and to answer queries to aRDF theories. We show that annotated RDF supports users who need to think about the uncertainty, temporal aspects, and provenance of the RDF triples in an RDF database. We develop a prototype aRDF implementation and show that our algorithms work efficiently even on real world data sets containing over 10 million triples. © 2010 ACM.","citedby-count":"56","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304","afid":"60020304","affilname":"University of Maryland","affiliation-city":"College Park","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/13605801800","authid":"13605801800","authname":"Udrea O.","surname":"Udrea","given-name":"Octavian","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006050903","authid":"7006050903","authname":"Subrahmanian V.","surname":"Subrahmanian","given-name":"V.

The characteristics of P2P systems make them a very good choice for multimedia content distribution over IP networks. However, although P2P technology gives new opportunities to define an efficient multimedia streaming application, at the same time it involves a set of technical challenges and issues due to the best-effort service offered by the Internet and its dynamic and heterogeneous nature. The most of existent protocols for video communications over P2P mainly focus on tree topology maintenance, without paying any attention to the encoding problem. The idea of this paper is to propose a multipoint video broadcast framework over a heterogeneous content distribution P2P network. In the proposed system the source generates the video flow by using an MPEG-4/FGS encoder, in such a way that no losses occur at the Baselayer stream even in the presence of short-term bandwidth fluctuations. Although in the past the FGS was not employed due to its encoding complexity, today, thanks to advances in hardware technology, we were able to develop an MPEG-4/FGS encoder on low-cost PCs which turned out to be more feasible and appealing for its flexibility. The FGS layer is sent together with the Base layer, but with a lower priority. The source uses a rate controller to regulate the encoding rate of the Base layer. To this aim, a protocol is defined in order to provide the source with information related to the most stringent bottleneck link on the overlay network. A technique to reorganize the content distribution tree is proposed and discussed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework a case study is introduced; improvements obtained with respect to several reference cases where FGS is not applied are also shown.

To do this in an unsupervised fashion requires the ability to find graphs that are similar to one another. That is the purpose of GraphClust. The GraphClust algorithm proceeds in three phases, often building on other tools: (1) it finds highly connected substructures in each graph; (2) it uses those substructures to represent each graph as a feature vector; and (3) it clusters these feature vectors using a standard distance measure. We validate the cluster quality by using the Silhouette method. In addition to clustering graphs, GraphClust uses SVD decomposition to find frequently co-occurring connected substructures.

We propose an AAC-based sentiment analysis technique that uses a linguistic analysis of adverbs of degree. We define a set of general axioms (based on a classification of adverbs of degree into five categories) that all adverb scoring techniques must satisfy. Instead of aggregating scores of both adverbs and adjectives using simple scoring functions, we propose an axiomatic treatment of AACs based on the linguistic classification of adverbs. Three specific AAC scoring methods that satisfy the axioms are presented. We describe the results of experiments on an annotated set of 200 news articles (annotated by 10 students) and compare our algorithms with some existing sentiment analysis algorithms. We show that our results lead to higher accuracy based on Pearson correlation with human subjects.","citedby-count":"172","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020304","afid":"60020304","affilname":"University of Maryland","affiliation-city":"College Park","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017293","afid":"60017293","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II","affiliation-city":"Naples","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114179621","afid":"114179621","affilname":"IRIT - University Paul Sabatier","affiliation-city":null,"affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12239481900","authid":"12239481900","authname":"Benamara F.","surname":"Benamara","given-name":"Farah","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114179621"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22833554600","authid":"22833554600","authname":"Cesarano C.","surname":"Cesarano","given-name":"Carmine","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202439624","authid":"57202439624","authname":"Picariello A.","surname":"Picariello","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017293"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020304"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006050903","authid":"7006050903","authname":"Subrahmanian V.","surname":"Subrahmanian","given-name":"V.

Many well-known methods of text clustering make use of a long list of words as vector space which is often unsatisfactory for a couple of reasons: first, it keeps the dimensionality of the data very high, and second, it ignores important relationships between terms like synonyms or antonyms. Our unsupervised method solves both problems by using ANNIE and WordNet lexical categories and WordNet ontology in order to create a well structured document vector space whose low dimensionality allows common clustering algorithms to perform well. For the clustering step we have chosen the bisecting k-means and the Multipole tree, a modified version of the Antipole tree data structure for, respectively, their accuracy and speed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","citedby-count":"46","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"authkeywords":"Antipole | Bisecting k-means | Clustering | Multipole | Text documents | WordNet","source-id":"15133","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548386174"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548386174?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548386174&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34548386174&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/34548386174","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:34548386174","eid":"2-s2.0-34548386174","dc:title":"Advanced indexing schema for imaging applications: Three case studies","dc:creator":"Battiato S.","prism:publicationName":"IET Image Processing","prism:issn":"17519659","prism:volume":"1","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"249-268","prism:coverDate":"2007-09-07","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2007","prism:doi":"10.1049/iet-ipr:20060315","dc:description":"Imaging techniques and applications often require heavy computations for finding the k-nearest-neighbour of a given pattern. Texture synthesis, image colourisation and super-resolution are all affected by this issue. Advanced clustering-based indexing schemas over metric spaces speed-up efficiently both k-nearest-neighbour and range searches. By using them, we are able to save CPU time without losing quality which would be lost using approximate approaches. Moreover, with the proposed technique we are able to convert a batch process task into a real-time task and, more importantly, it might be run on a typical user-end PC desktop rather than powerful mainframes. It has been shown how the application of recently reported well-known indexing schemas improves the speed performance of the above problems. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603989025","authid":"6603989025","authname":"Battiato S.","surname":"Battiato","given-name":"S.","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8587282500","authid":"8587282500","authname":"Di Blasi G.","surname":"Di Blasi","given-name":"G.","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato D.","surname":"Reforgiato","given-name":"D.","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]}],"source-id":"5400152646","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
