This paper describes a novel method for generating and integrating knowledge graphs extracted from multiple natural language sources by FRED, a machine reading tool for generating abstract representations of text documents. This is a key problem in human-robot spoken dialogue interaction, issue which arises from a current research project related to active and healthy ageing using caring service robots where we are involved. The problem is also relevant in many application scenarios requiring the creation and dynamic evolution of a knowledge base, such as automatic news summarisation. Solving this problem requires solving sub-tasks that have only been studied individually, so far. We propose a holistic approach to handle FRED's graphs related to different input texts and output a knowledge graph representing the reconciled knowledge.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24339046000","authid":"24339046000","authname":"Mongiovì M.","surname":"Mongiovì","given-name":"Misael","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]}],"authkeywords":"Knowledge integration | Machine reading | Semantic reconciliation","article-number":"25","source-id":"21100787012","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968616637"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968616637?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84968616637&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84968616637&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968616637","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84968616637","eid":"2-s2.0-84968616637","dc:title":"An urban fault reporting and management platform for smart cities","dc:creator":"Consoli S.","prism:publicationName":"WWW 2015 Companion - Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450334730"}],"prism:pageRange":"535-540","prism:coverDate":"2015-05-18","prism:coverDisplayDate":"18 May 2015","prism:doi":"10.1145/2740908.2743910","dc:description":"A good interaction between public administrations and citizens is imperative in modern smart cities. Semantic web technologies can aid in achieving such a goal. We present a smart urban fault reporting web platform to help citizens in reporting common urban problems, such as street faults, potholes or broken street lights, and to support the local public administration in responding and fixing those problems quickly. The tool is based on a semantic data model designed for the city, which integrates several distinct data sources, opportunely re-engineered to meet the principles of the Semantic Web and linked open data. The platform supports the whole process of road maintenance, from the fault reporting to the management of maintenance activities. The integration of multiple data sources enables increasing interoperability and heterogeneous information retrieval, thus favoring the development of effective smart urban fault reporting services. Our platform was evaluated in a real case study: a complete urban reporting and road maintenance system has been developed for the municipality of Catania. Our approach is completely generalizable and can be adopted by and customized for other cities.

The ultimate goal is to boost the metropolis towards the route of a modern smart city and improve urban life. Our platform exhibits a consistent, minimal and comprehensive semantic data model for the city based on the Linked Open Data paradigm. Both the model and the data are publically accessible thorough dedicated user-friendly services, which allow citizens to observe and interact with the work of the public administration. Our platform also enables interested businesses and programmers to develop front-end services on the top of it. We describe the methodology used to extract data from sources, enrich them, building an ontology that describes them and publish them under the Linked Open Data paradigm. We include in our description employed tools and technologies.

As use case we report on the usage of the application at the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) in May 2014.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102538","afid":"60102538","affilname":"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","affiliation-city":"Karlsruhe","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007951","afid":"60007951","affilname":"Fujitsu Ltd.","affiliation-city":"Tokyo","affiliation-country":"Japan"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60001881","afid":"60001881","affilname":"University of Sheffield","affiliation-city":"Sheffield","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/100407023","afid":"100407023","affilname":"ISTC-CNR","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23392611200","authid":"23392611200","authname":"Gentile A.","surname":"Gentile","given-name":"Anna Lisa","initials":"A.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60001881"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36699349400","authid":"36699349400","authname":"Acosta M.","surname":"Acosta","given-name":"Maribel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102538"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53979719800","authid":"53979719800","authname":"Costabello L.","surname":"Costabello","given-name":"Luca","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007951"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100407023"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100407023"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"100407023"}]}],"authkeywords":"ESWC data management | LiveConf | Semantic Conference Mananger | Semantic Web Dog Food","source-id":"21100461330","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943014678"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943014678?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943014678&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84943014678&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943014678","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84943014678","eid":"2-s2.0-84943014678","dc:title":"Sentilo: Frame-Based Sentiment Analysis","dc:creator":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","prism:publicationName":"Cognitive Computation","prism:issn":"18669956","prism:eIssn":"18669964","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"211-225","prism:coverDate":"2015-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/s12559-014-9302-z","dc:description":"© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Sentilo is an unsupervised, domain-independent system that performs sentiment analysis by hybridizing natural language processing techniques and semantic Web technologies. Given a sentence expressing an opinion, Sentilo recognizes its holder, detects the topics and subtopics that it targets, links them to relevant situations and events referred to by it and evaluates the sentiment expressed on each topic/subtopic. Sentilo relies on a novel lexical resource, which enables a proper propagation of sentiment scores from topics to subtopics, and on a formal model expressing the semantics of opinion sentences. Sentilo provides its output as a RDF graph, and whenever possible it resolves holders’ and topics’ identity on Linked Data.","citedby-count":"54","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","surname":"Reforgiato Recupero","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]}],"authkeywords":"Conceptual frames | Opinion mining | Sentic computing | Sentiment analysis","source-id":"19400158515","fund-acr":"MIUR","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951310108"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951310108?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951310108&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951310108&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951310108","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951310108","eid":"2-s2.0-84951310108","dc:title":"ESWC 15 challenge on concept-level sentiment analysis","dc:creator":"Recupero D.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319255170"}],"prism:volume":"548","prism:pageRange":"211-222","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-25518-7_18","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. A consequence of the massive use of social networks, blogs, wikis, etc., is the change of users’ behaviour on, and their interaction with, the Web: opinions, emotions and sentiments are now expressed differently from the past. Lexical understanding of text is not anymore enough to detect sentiment polarities. Semantics became key for sentiment detection. This generates potential business opportunities, especially within the marketing area, and key stakeholders need to catch up with the latest technology if they want to be compelling in the market. Therefore, understanding the opinions and its peculiarities from a written text involves a deep understanding of natural language text and the semantics behind it. Recently, it has been proved that the use of semantics improves the accuracy of existing sentiment analysis systems, which are mainly based on pure machine learning or other statistical approaches. The second Edition of the Concept Level Sentiment Analysis challenge aims to provide a further stimulus in this direction by offering to researchers an event where they can learn and experiment on how to employ Semantic Web features within their sentiment analysis systems, aiming at reaching higher performance.","citedby-count":"14","prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/19638448200","authid":"19638448200","authname":"Dragoni M.","surname":"Dragoni","given-name":"Mauro","initials":"M."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V."}],"source-id":"17700155007","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951299530"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951299530?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951299530&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951299530&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951299530","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84951299530","eid":"2-s2.0-84951299530","dc:title":"MACJa: Metadata and citations jailbreaker","dc:creator":"Nuzzolese A.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319255170"}],"prism:volume":"548","prism:pageRange":"117-128","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-25518-7_10","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

The entire electricity infrastructure and associated socio-technical system including transmission and distribution networks, the system operator, suppliers, generators, consumers and market mechanisms will need to evolve to realize the full potential of smart-grids. At the heart of this evolution is the integration of information and communication technology (ICT) and energy infrastructures for increasingly decentralized development, monitoring and management of a resilient grid. This paper identifies the challenges of integration and four key areas of future research and development at the intersection of energy and ICT: standards-based interoperability, reliability and security, decentralized and self-organizing grid architecture, and innovative business models to unlock the potential of the energy value chain. The ideas postulated here are envisaged to act as a starting-point for future RandD direction.","citedby-count":"19","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

A crucial problem faced in our pilot settings was to enable personalized tracking of water consumption in a non-enforcing and invasive way. This paper presents two scenarios of such a system using storyboards that describe them in a university building setup, trying to encourage students to become more water aware. The paper continues to present the findings from the user tests conducted in the experiments in two pilot sites and concluded by presenting the changes in the design of the final application for the public space environment.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008539","afid":"60008539","affilname":"National University of Ireland Galway","affiliation-city":"Galway","affiliation-country":"Ireland"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/116373224","afid":"116373224","affilname":"VTEC ENGINEERING BV","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"9"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16643447200","authid":"16643447200","authname":"Kouroupetroglou C.","surname":"Kouroupetroglou","given-name":"Christos","initials":"C."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56825783200","authid":"56825783200","authname":"Piso M.","surname":"Piso","given-name":"Maarten","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/38361290300","authid":"38361290300","authname":"Derguech W.","surname":"Derguech","given-name":"Wassim","initials":"W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12790805000","authid":"12790805000","authname":"Curry E.","surname":"Curry","given-name":"Edward","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008539"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56521095000","authid":"56521095000","authname":"Mink J.","surname":"Mink","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"116373224"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54929377800","authid":"54929377800","authname":"Raciti M.","surname":"Raciti","given-name":"Massimiliano","initials":"M."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "8", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56825840300","authid":"56825840300","authname":"Van Slooten J.","surname":"Van Slooten","given-name":"Jesse","initials":"J."},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "9", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55504294400","authid":"55504294400","authname":"Coakley D.","surname":"Coakley","given-name":"Daniel","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008539"}]}],"authkeywords":"Habit formation | Innovation | Raising awareness | Technology | User experience | Water measurement","source-id":"18700156717","fund-no":"Programme","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928557735"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928557735?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928557735&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928557735&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84928557735","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84928557735","eid":"2-s2.0-84928557735","dc:title":"SHELDON: Semantic holistic framework for linked ontology data","dc:creator":"Recupero D.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319179650"}],"prism:volume":"8982","prism:pageRange":"136-139","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-17966-7_17","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Sentiment Analysis research has proved to bring several benefits for what performances are concerned and has allowed to identify new challenging tasks to be accomplished. Semantics helps structuring the plain natural language text with formal representation. The current system we are developing performs sentiment analysis by hybridizing natural language processing techniques with Semantic Web technologies. Our system, called Sentilo, is able to recognize the holder of an opinion, to detect the topics and sub-topics in its scope, and to measure the sentiment expressed by them. This information is formally represented by means of RDF graphs according to an OWL opinion ontology, while holders and topics identity is resolved on the Linked Open Data cloud.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55976373100","authid":"55976373100","authname":"Spampinato D.","surname":"Spampinato","given-name":"Daria","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]}],"authkeywords":"Semantic features | Sentic computing | Sentiment analysis","source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926314925"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926314925?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926314925&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84926314925&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926314925","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84926314925","eid":"2-s2.0-84926314925","dc:title":"Towards emergency vehicle routing using Geolinked Open Data: The case study of the Municipality of Catania","dc:creator":"Consoli S.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"1329","prism:pageRange":"31-42","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","dc:description":"Linked Open Data (LOD) has gained significant momentum over the past years as a best practice of promoting the sharing and publication of structured data on the semantic Web. Currently LOD is reaching significant adoption also in Public Administrations (PAs), where it is often required to be connected to existing platforms, such as GIS-based data management systems. Bearing on previous experience with the pioneering data.cnr.it, through Semantic Scout, as well as the Agency for Digital Italy recommendations for LOD in Italian PA, we are working on the extraction, publication, and exploitation of data from the Geographic Information System of the Municipality of Catania, referred to as SIT (\"Sistema Informativo Territoriale\"). The goal is to boost the metropolis towards the route of a modern Smart City by providing prototype integrated solutions supporting transport, public health, urban decor, and social services, to improve urban life. In particular a mobile application focused on real-time road traffic and public transport management is currently under development to support sustainable mobility and, especially, to aid the response to urban emergencies, from small accidents to more serious disasters. This paper describes the results and lessons learnt from the first work campaign, aiming at analyzing, reengineering, linking, and formalizing the Shape-based geo-data from the SIT.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum

In this paper we present a domain-independent framework that creates a sentiment analysis model by mixing Semantic Web technologies with natural language processing approaches (This work is supported by the project PRISMA SMART CITIES, funded by the Italian Ministry of Research and Education under the program PON.). Our system, called Sentilo, provides a core sentiment analysis engine which fully exploits semantics. It identifies the holder of an opinion, topics and sub-topics the opinion is referred to, and assesses the opinion trigger. Sentilo uses an OWL opinion ontology to represent all this information with an RDF graph where holders and topics are resolved on Linked Data. Anyone can plug its own opinion scoring algorithm to compute scores of opinion expressing words and come up with a combined scoring algorithm for each identified entities and the overall sentence.","citedby-count":"13","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021199","afid":"60021199","affilname":"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55976373100","authid":"55976373100","authname":"Spampinato D.","surname":"Spampinato","given-name":"Daria","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021199"}]}],"authkeywords":"Semantic features | Sentic computing | Sentiment analysis","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908670220"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908670220?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908670220&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908670220&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908670220","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84908670220","eid":"2-s2.0-84908670220","dc:title":"Setting the course of emergency vehicle routing using Geolinked open data for the municipality of catania","dc:creator":"Consoli S.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319119540"}],"prism:volume":"8798","prism:pageRange":"42-53","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-11955-7_4","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. Linked Open Data (LOD) has gained significant momentum over the past years as a best practice of promoting the sharing and publication of structured data on the semantic Web. Currently LOD is reaching significant adoption also in Public Administrations (PAs), where it is often required to be connected to existing platforms, such as GIS-based data management systems. Bearing on previous experience with the pioneering data.cnr.it, through Semantic Scout, as well as the Agency for Digital Italy recommendations for LOD in Italian PA, we are working on the extraction, publication, and exploitation of data from the Geographic Information System of the Municipality of Catania, referred to as SIT (“Sistema Informativo Territoriale”). The goal is to boost the metropolis towards the route of a modern Smart City by providing prototype integrated solutions supporting transport, public health, urban decor, and social services, to improve urban life. In particular a mobile application focused on real-time road traffic and public transport management is currently under development to support sustainable mobility and, especially, to aid the response to urban emergencies, from small accidents to more serious disasters. This paper describes the results and lessons learnt from the first work campaign, aiming at analyzing, reengineering, linking, and formalizing the Shape-based geo-data from the SIT.","citedby-count":"6","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60028218","afid":"60028218","affilname":"Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna","affiliation-city":"Bologna","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60009647","afid":"60009647","affilname":"Universite Paris 13","affiliation-city":"Villetaneuse","affiliation-country":"France"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60009647"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35183805200","authid":"35183805200","authname":"Peroni S.","surname":"Peroni","given-name":"Silvio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60028218"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55976373100","authid":"55976373100","authname":"Spampinato D.","surname":"Spampinato","given-name":"Daria","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]}],"authkeywords":"Emergency vehicle routing | Geo-linked open data applications | Linked egovernment data extraction and publication | Sustainable mobility","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908556143"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908556143?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908556143&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908556143&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84908556143","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84908556143","eid":"2-s2.0-84908556143","dc:title":"ESWC’14 challenge on Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis","dc:creator":"Reforgiato Recupero D.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319120232"}],"prism:volume":"475","prism:pageRange":"3-20","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-12024-9_1","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014. With the introduction of social networks, blogs, wikis, etc., the users’ behavior and their interaction in the Web have changed. As a consequence, people express their opinions and sentiments in a totally different way with respect to the past. All this information hinders potential business opportunities, especially within the advertising world, and key stakeholders need to catch up with the latest technology if they want to be at the forefront in the market. In practical terms, the automatic analysis of online opinions involves a deep understanding of natural language text, and it has been proved that the use of semantics improves the accuracy of existing sentiment analysis systems based on classical machine learning or statistical approaches. To this end, the Concept Level Sentiment Analysis challenge aims to provide a push in this direction offering the researchers an event where they can learn new approaches for the employment of Semantic Web features within their systems of sentiment analysis bringing to better performance and higher accuracy. The challenge aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provides novel methods to process opinion data from unstructured textual information to structured machine-processable data.","citedby-count":"11","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60078616","afid":"60078616","affilname":"Nanyang

This paper describes the results and lessons learnt from the first campaign, aiming at analysing, reengineering, linking, and formalizing the Shape-based geo-data from the SIT. © 2014 ACM.","citedby-count":"9","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55605133800","authid":"55605133800","authname":"Gangemi A.","surname":"Gangemi","given-name":"Aldo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42862074000","authid":"42862074000","authname":"Nuzzolese A.","surname":"Nuzzolese","given-name":"Andrea Giovanni","initials":"A.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35183805200","authid":"35183805200","authname":"Peroni S.","surname":"Peroni","given-name":"Silvio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55885160000","authid":"55885160000","authname":"Presutti V.","surname":"Presutti","given-name":"Valentina","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55976373100","authid":"55976373100","authname":"Spampinato D.","surname":"Spampinato","given-name":"Daria","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]}],"authkeywords":"eGovernment | GIS-based data management | Linked Open Data extraction and publication | Open Data applications","source-id":"11600154611","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893468103"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893468103?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893468103&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84893468103&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84893468103","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84893468103","eid":"2-s2.0-84893468103","dc:title":"A survey on tidal analysis and forecasting methods for Tsunami detection","dc:creator":"Consoli S.","prism:publicationName":"Science of Tsunami Hazards","prism:issn":"87556839","prism:volume":"33","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"1-56","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"January 2014","dc:description":"Accurate analysis and forecasting of tidal level are very important tasks for human activities in oceanic and coastal areas. They can be crucial in catastrophic situations like occurrences of Tsunamis in order to provide a rapid alerting to the human population involved and to save lives. Conventional tidal forecasting methods are based on harmonic analysis using the least squares method to determine harmonic parameters. However, a large number of parameters and long-term measured data are required for precise tidal level predictions with harmonic analysis. Furthermore, traditional harmonic methods rely on models based on the analysis of astronomical components and they can be inadequate when the contribution of non-astronomical components, such as the weather, is significant. Other alternative approaches have been developed in the literature in order to deal with these situations and provide predictions with the desired accuracy, with respect also to the length of the available tidal record. These methods include standard high or band pass filtering techniques, although the relatively deterministic character and large amplitude of tidal signals make special techniques, like artificial neural networks and wavelets transform analysis methods, more effective. This paper is intended to provide the communities of both researchers and practitioners with a broadly applicable, up to date coverage of tidal analysis and forecasting methodologies that have proven to be successful in a variety of circumstances, and that hold particular promise for success in the future. Classical and novel methods are reviewed in a systematic and consistent way, outlining their main concepts and components, similarities and differences, advantages and disadvantages.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103695","afid":"60103695","affilname":"European Commission Joint Research Centre","affiliation-city":"Brussels","affiliation-country":"Belgium"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012572","afid":"60012572","affilname":"Istituto Di Scienze E Tecnologie Della Cognizione, Rome","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"re","subtypeDescription":"Review","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24168054400","authid":"24168054400","authname":"Consoli S.","surname":"Consoli","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103695"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012572"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35241629900","authid":"35241629900","authname":"Zavarella V.","surname":"Zavarella","given-name":"Vanni","initials":"V.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103695"}]}],"source-id":"12100156741","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
