A cultural reasoning architecture is composed of several components, including a Semantic Web engine to collect data about an organization, an opinion-mining engine to collect the organization's opinions, and an algorithm to correlate environmental variables with the actions of organizations. These components of the architecture are satisfied by the Cognitive Architecture for Reasoning about Adversaries (CARA). CARA uses the Story system to collect data from the Semantic Web engine in RDF format. The Story system extracts facts by learning rules from annotated sentences and CARA automatically learns rules to extract RDF triples from new sentences that are unable to match annotated sentences.

Forr example, Martha Stewart's company may have wished to assess the degree of harshness of news articles about her in the recent past. Likewise, a World Bank official may wish to assess the degree of criticism of a proposed dam in Bangladesh. The ability to gauge opinion on a given topic is therefore of critical interest. In this paper, we develop a suite of algorithms which take as input, a set D of documents as well as a topic t, and gauge the degree of opinion expressed about topic t in the set D of documents. Our algorithms can return both a number (larger the number, more positive the opinion) as well as a qualitative opinion (e.g. harsh, complimentary). We assess the accuracy of these algorithms via human experiments and show that the best of these algorithms can accurately reflect human opinions. We have also conducted performance experiments showing that our algorithms are computationally fast. Copyright © 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Given a database S of objects in a metric space M and a query object q in M, in a range searching problem the goal is to find the objects of 5 within some threshold distance to q, whereas in a k-nearest neighbor searching problem, the q elements of 5 closest to q must be produced. These problems can obviously be solved with a linear number of distance calculations, by comparing the query object against every object in the database. However, the goal is to solve such problems much faster. We combine and extend ideas from the M-Tree, the Multivantage Point structure, and the FQ-Tree to create a new structure in the \"bisector tree\" class, called the Antipole Tree. Bisection is based on the proximity to an \"Antipole\" pair of elements generated by a suitable linear randomized tournament. The final winners a, b of such a tournament are far enough apart to approximate the diameter of the splitting set. If dist(a, b) is larger than the chosen cluster diameter threshold, then the cluster is split. The proposed data structure is an indexing scheme suitable for (exact and approximate) best match searching on generic metric spaces. The Antipole Tree outperforms by a factor of approximately two existing structures such as List of Clusters, M-Trees, and others and, in many cases, it achieves better clustering properties. © 2005 IEEE.","citedby-count":"44","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021784","afid":"60021784","affilname":"New York University","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010146","afid":"60010146","affilname":"Università degli Studi di Catania","affiliation-city":"Catania","affiliation-country":"Italy"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55892604800","authid":"55892604800","authname":"Cantone D.","surname":"Cantone","given-name":"Domenico","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190518739","authid":"57190518739","authname":"Ferro A.","surname":"Ferro","given-name":"Alfredo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/34977484800","authid":"34977484800","authname":"Pulvirenti A.","surname":"Pulvirenti","given-name":"Alfredo","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57206674454","authid":"57206674454","authname":"Recupero D.","surname":"Recupero","given-name":"Diego Reforgiato","initials":"D.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010146"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7005430203","authid":"7005430203","authname":"Shasha D.","surname":"Shasha","given-name":"Dennis","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021784"}]}],"authkeywords":"Indexing methods | Information search and retrieval | Similarity measures","source-id":"17362","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
