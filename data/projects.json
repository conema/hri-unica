        "text": "<h4>Managing Active and healthy aging with use of caRing servIce robots.</h4><p>MARIO addresses the difficult challenges of loneliness, isolation and dementia in older persons through innovative and multi-faceted inventions delivered by service robots. The effects of these conditions are severe and life-limiting. They burden individuals and societal support systems. Human intervention is costly but the severity can be prevented and/or mitigated by simple changes in self-perception and brain stimulation mediated by robots.</p><p>From this unique combination, clear advances are made in the use of semantic data analytics, personal interaction, and unique applications tailored to better connect older persons to their care providers, community, own social circle and also to their personal interests. Each objective is developed with a focus on loneliness, isolation and dementia. The impact centres on deep progress toward EU scientific and market leadership in service robots and a user driven solution for this major societal challenge. The competitive advantage is the ability to treat tough challenges appropriately. In addition, a clear path has been developed on how to bring MARIO solutions to the end users through market deployment.</p>"

At this scope, a radically new ICT Robotics concepts and solutions will be introduced, in which humans, IoT devices, and AI-powered social robots and objects connected to Cloud will harmoniously exist as a kind of “cognitive agent” that anticipates human needs and provides assistance, monitoring and coaching solutions. The technological objective of the SI-ROBOTICS Proposal is to achieve step changes that enable connected robots to take on more “human” capabilities and traits, such as perceiving, adapting, learning, manipulating and interacting. The distinctive feature is the design and implementation of advanced behavioural models of interaction, conceived to establish a high positive perception of care presence in order to empower and motivate elderly people to actively participate in their care process.</p><p>The SI-ROBOTICS Proposal is conceived to demonstrate the technical feasibility, acceptability and economical sustainability of the SI-ROBOTICS solution within the context of elder care facilities and home environments, which are usually characterized by the presence of frail people, requiring gentle and dedicated attention and interaction, and caregiver and medical operators, working with very scheduled and demanding tasks. The ambition here is also to provide and evaluate novel care processes of continuum of care through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity of care in domestic and residential settings.</p><p>The outcome of this Proposal will be also the capability to strengthen and foster an environment of innovation in the automation and robotic community in South Italy, thus supporting the launch of potential start-ups, not only in healthcare domain, but also in other ICT Robotics related ones, such as logistic, medical, cleaning, etc...</p>"
